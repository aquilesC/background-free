\section{Introduction}
High-resolution microscopy has become an indispensable tool for studying
biological samples both in vitro and in vivo\cite{Moerner2007}.
Fluorescent organic dyes are commonly employed to such ends because of their
reduced size and high quantum yield\cite{Lichtman2005}. Fluorophores, however,
have an inherent constraint  in the possible observation time, since molecules
eventually bleach under intense irradiation\cite{Shaner2005}. Even dyes with a
high photo-stability cannot be imaged for longer than few tens of seconds. Gold
nanoparticles on the other hand are almost indefinitely stable\cite{Jana2001}
and open up many original applications including photothermal
therapy\cite{Alkilany2012} and imaging\cite{VandenBroek2013}.

As gold nanoparticles do not blink nor bleach\cite{PEREZJUSTE2005}
\cite{Mohamed2000},they are ideal candidates for labeling, tracking and
manipulating biological samples over extended periods of time. Moreover it has
been shown that they don't interfere with cells' functioning\cite{Lewinski2008},
allowing not only \em{in vitro} but also \em{in vivo} studies. Compared to
organic dyes, gold nanoparticles are much larger and their emission
quantum yield is much smaller, in the order of $10^{-6}$\cite{Yorulmaz2012}.
This minute value is compensated by an absorption cross section several orders
of magnitude larger than that of molecules\cite{Link1999}, therefore the
brightness of goldl nanoparticles is comparable to that of fluorescent molecules.

Since the absorption cross section of the particles scales as their volume, detecting
smaller particles in presence of background requires a specific approach.
Several techniques have been proposed, including two-photon
excitation\cite{VandenBroek2013}, photothermal heterodyne
detection\cite{Berciaud2006} and interferometric detection\cite{Ignatovich2006}.
All these methods are useful but their operation requires dedicated setups and a high level of
expertise. A method that allows to image gold nanoparticles with
a high background rejection and that is readily implementable in current
confocal and wide-field microscopes would provide great benefits.

Gold nanoparticles exhibit a collective oscillation of conduction electrons
called surface plasmon resonance\cite{Bouhelier2005}. This resonance strongly
depends on the shape of the particles\cite{Dulkeith2004}\cite{Link2000a}.
Spheres with radius roughly between $5$ and $80\nm$ will have a resonance
between $520\nm$ and $560\nm$; more elongated particles such as nano-rods or
bipyramids\cite{Rao2015} exhibit red-shifted resonance wavelengths that reach $800\nm$ or
longer\cite{Ngoc2015}. It is important to note that tuning the shape of the
particles can be easily achieved by synthesis and that relatively narrow
size distributions can be obtained\cite{Nikoobakht2003}.

The plasmon is responsible for enhanced absorption and scattering cross
sections\cite{Ni2008} of particles for specific wavelengths but it is also
responsible for enhanced photoluminescence emission in the spectral region of the
plasmon resonance. Because of the absence of a gap in the excited
states spectrum of gold nanoparticles, their photoluminescence excitation spectra overlaps
their emission spectrum\cite{Yorulmaz2012} , a very different situation from the Stokes-shifted
emission of molecules and semiconductor nanocrystals. Upon excitation of gold nanoparticles at
the plasmon resonance, their absorption maximum, most of the emission will be concentrated in
a narrow spectral region around the excitation. This implies that most of the luminescence will be
blocked by the filters that, in single molecule experiments, prevent direct excitation light from reaching the detectors.

It is also possible to excite the particles off-resonance with a shorter
wavelength laser (for instance at $532\,\nm$) and the emission will be mostly
concentrated around the plasmon resonance. This is the closest situation to the
behavior of a fluorophore, in which the Stokes-shifted emission can be easily
detected by introducing a long-pass filter. The drawback, however, is that the
cross section of particles is much smaller at this wavelength and can only be
compensated by increasing the excitation power.

This work focuses in the exploitation of the anti-Stokes luminescence\cite{Jiang2013},
which benefits from the enhanced absorption cross section of the particles, their high photo-stability
and fairly narrow emission spectra. Anti-Stokes luminescence refers to the emission at shorter
wavelengths than the excitation. When exciting in resonance with the plasmon, a short-pass
filter can be introduced for observing only this anti-Stokes emission. The main
advantage of this procedure is that it highly reduces the background arising
from self-fluorescence and Raman-scattering from cells, most of it being Stokes-shifted,
thereby reducing background and opening the possibility
of imaging and tracking smaller particles or using lower excitation powers.

	\caption{REWRITE WITH NEW FIGURE Schematic of the anti-Stokes luminescence arising from a single gold
	nanorod. The emission with a higher energy than the excitation energy can be
	explained by an interaction between the electron and the phonons in the metal}
	\label{fig:anti-Stokes-process}
\end{figure}

The anti-Stokes emission mechanism\cite{He2015} is depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:anti-Stokes-process} and can be described as follows: an absorbed
photon generates an electron-hole pair with an energy difference equivalent to
the energy of the incoming photon. After interacting with the thermal bath, i.e.
with a phonon of the gold lattice\cite{Lin2008} or a thermally excited charge carrier, either the hole or the electron can receive energy.
This energy will transiently increase the energy difference between electron
and hole; if they recombine radiatively, the emitted photon will have a shorter
wavelength (higher energy) than the incoming photon\cite{Huang2014}. The same
mechanism can account for the Stokes-shifted emission, the only
difference being that electron or hole lose energy to the lattice before
recombining radiatively.

It has to be kept in mind that the probability of a radiative recombination of
electron and holes is very low, as can be experimentally determined by the very low
emission quantum yield of the particles. Anti-Stokes emission stemps from electron-hole
recombination events after the electron-hole pair has gained energy from the lattice, before it thermalizes.
Even if the anti-Stokes scenario is unlikely, it is frequent enough as to
observe an intensity in the range of $10^3$ counts per second on an avalanche
photodiode with excitation powers around $16\pwr$. Such relatively high detection rates require
enhancement of the emission probability through the proximity of the plasmon
resonance\cite{Neupane2013}.

The main advantage of the approach presented in this work is the simplicity of
its implementation. With any confocal or wide-field setup enabling resonant excitation
of gold nano-particles, one can exploit the anti-Stokes photoluminescence by inserting a
proper short-pass filter in the detection path. Single gold nanoparticles can be detected even in
higher background conditions such as a stained cell, or a highly
self-fluorescent sample.

\section{Experimental method}
Images of gold nanorods were recorded by sample scanning employing a XYZ piezo
stage (PI Nano Cube) in a  home-built confocal microscope, sketched in Figure
\ref{fig:setup}a. The objective employed was an oil-immersion Olympus 60X NA
$1.4$ that allowed a high efficiency in both exciting the particles and
collecting their emission. The luminescence arising from the particles was
filtered and detected by either an avalanche photodiode or a
liquid-nitrogen-cooled CCD-spectrometer (Acton $500\textrm{i}$). An example of
an image can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:setup}b. For detecting the anti-Stokes
luminescence, a $633\nm$ short-pass filter (Semrock) was added to the detection
path together with a $633\nm$ notch filter. Both filters were needed
simultaneously since either of them is not able to entirely block the excitation
light from the detectors. The Stokes luminescence was collected replacing the
short-pass filter with a $633\nm$ long-pass (Semrock).

Gold nanorods were synthesized by following the standard seeded-growth
method\cite{Nikoobakht2003}. The average size of the nanorods was $50\nm\times
23\nm$ and their SPR is located at around $630\nm$ in water. Figure
\ref{fig:uvvis} shows the extinction spectrum of a suspension of the
nanoparticles after synthesis and fig. \ref{fig:TEM} shows a TEM image of the
rods.

Two different laser wavelengths were employed. A $532\nm$ laser (CNI) was
used for exciting the transverse plasmon and collect the full longitudinal
plasmon spectrum. Single nanorods exhibit a narrow Lorentzian-shaped luminescence spectrum as displayed
in Figure \ref{fig:setup}c. A second laser (Thorlabs HeNe) with a wavelength of
$633\nm$ allowed us to excite the particles in resonance and collect either the
Stokes or the anti-Stokes emission depending on the introduced filters.

\begin{figure}[htp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/02_Intensity_SPR/Intensity_SPR.png}
\caption{Emission intensity of different gold nanorods as a function of their plasmon peak position. The data are plotted for the
anti-Stokes (a) and Stokes (b) sides of the emission; the orange vertical line
at $633\nm$ is the wavelength of the laser. The spread in intensities for
similar peak positions can be attributed to variations in sizes and to different
orientations of the rods in the circularly polarized beam. The
maximum emission for the anti-Stokes is obtained when the plasmon is slightly
blue shifted from the excitation laser and viceversa for the Stokes emission.}
	\label{fig:emission_peak_position}
\end{figure} 

Figure \ref{fig:emission_peak_position} shows a scatter plot of the Stokes and anti-Stokes emission
intensities of about 75 gold nanorods against their plasmon peak position. The dispersion of the points observed can be attributed to the
distribution of sizes of the rods inherent to the synthesis
method\cite{Zijlstra2011} (bigger particles will have a bigger cross section) and to different orientations.
It is possible to observe that the maximum emission intensity for the
anti-Stokes appears for those particles with their plasmon slightly blue-shifted
from the laser wavelength, while the opposite is observed for the Stokes
emission. This means that there is a trade-off between the excitation efficiency
and the collection efficiency: exciting in perfect resonance is more efficient,
but the filters will eliminate most of the luminescence. Therefore, exciting
slightly to the blue (red) of the resonance will be beneficial for the
(anti-)Stokes imaging.

To prove that the technique is well suited for imaging of particles in
biological conditions, we deposited HeLa cells on top of the nanorod sample.
Firstly, nanoparticles were deposited on clean glass coverslips by spin casting
a suspension of gold nanorods. This procedure ensures that the analysis is performed on
single nanorods and therefore that the luminescence signals are not arising from
clusters of nanorods. It also allowed us to characterize the nanorod emission both by
acquiring spectra and by studying the dependency with excitation power, avoiding
the diffusion away from the focus. 

Secondly, HeLa cells were incubated over night on top of these samples, ensuring
a high confluency. Although the obtained images are is not exactly equivalent to images
of gold nanorods in the middle of cells, they would resemble very closely  images of rods
in cell membranes. This simplified protocol only serves the present purpose of optical
signal-to-background characterization, and spared us the painstaking work of bio-compatible particle
functionalization that would be needed for more relevant biological assays. Figure
\ref{fig:white-light} shows a typical white light transmission image of the
samples. High confluency allows to confirm that cells cover uniformly the
entire observed area. In this way we can ensure that the studied nanorods are
always below a cell. We have also acquired images of nanoparticles under stained
cells. Staining was achieved by incubating the cells already attached to the
coverslips with $45\pM$ \atto for approximately twenty minutes. This set
of experiments allowed us to compare Stokes and anti-Stokes emissions under
high-background conditions.

\section{Results and discussion}

\begin{figure}[htp]

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/04_3_Curves/3_curves_final.png}
	\caption{Luminescence spectra of a single gold nanorod excited with a $532\nm$
	laser (green curve). The Stokes emission after excitation with a $633\nm$
	HeNe laser is the red curve and the blue curve corresponds to the anti-Stokes
	emission. These last two curves were normalized such that the Stokes emission
	overlaps the spectrum obtained with the $532\nm$ laser.}
	\label{fig:spectra_rod}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:spectra_rod} shows typical spectra of a gold nanorod under
different excitation wavelengths. The green curve is the one-photon-excited
luminescence spectrum around the longitudinal plasmon resonance,
observed while irradiating with $532\nm$ laser; the full
spectrum of the longitudinal plasmon is clearly observable with its resonance at
$620\nm$. The particle can also be excited at or close to this resonance; fig. 
\ref{fig:spectra_rod} shows the emission spectra under those conditions. The red
curve is the Stokes-shifted emission excited at $633\nm$ (the vertical
black line in the figure). The spectral shape of this emission overlaps with the
one observed exciting at $532\nm$; exciting in resonance is more efficient and
therefore the emission is much brighter. The blue curve displays the anti-Stokes
emission at shorter wavelengths. In this case the spectral shape doesn't
resemble that of the plasmon resonance. The exponential-like decay of the anti-Stokes spectrum can be modelled
with Boltzmann statistics\cite{He2015} of the bath (phonons and electrons) energy levels that are
present in gold nanoparticles at room temperature and will be the object of future work.

It has to be noted that for the nanoparticle observed in fig.
\ref{fig:spectra_rod}, the count rates for Stokes and anti-Stokes emissions are comparable.
As explained earlier and shown in Figure
\ref{fig:emission_peak_position}, this is because the excitation laser is resonant with the plasmon,
the most favorable position for enhancing the anti-Stokes part of the spectrum.
Both types of emission are also comparable to the luminescence intensity
obtained while exciting at $532\,\nm$. The main difference is the laser
intensity employed; the power density for exciting the transverse plasmon with
the $532\nm$ laser was set to $80\pwr$, while for both the anti-Stokes and
Stokes, the $633\nm$ laser was set to $15\pwr$, $5$ times less intense.
This suggests that the enhancement of absorption cross section at resonance
more than compensates the loss of a significant fraction of the luminescence emission in the laser rejection filter, allowing us to use lower power.

The three curves in Figure \ref{fig:spectra_rod} also show a very distinctive
spectral distribution. The luminescence that arises from the $532\nm$
excitation spans almost $150\nm$, from the laser wavelength up to
more than $650\nm$. The Lorentzian shape confirms that the emission arises from a single
nanorod. The long-pass emission (red curve) spans a range of
almost $100\nm$, from the excitation at $633\nm$ to above $700\nm$. Finally, the
anti-Stokes emission, which requires energy extraction from the thermal bath cannot extend much beyond a few XXXkBTXXX from the excitation energy.
This is the narrowest band, extending from the excitation to about $580\nm$.
The position of the plasmon resonance to the blue of the excitation laser explains the higher peak intensity of
the anti-Stokes spectrum compared to the Stokes spectrum, whereas the total integrated Stokes emission is higher than the anti-Stokes's.

	scale bar in both figures is $5\um$ in length.}
	\label{fig:stokes_as_no_dye}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:stokes_as_no_dye} shows two raster scans of the same
$15\times15\um^2$ area of the sample with HeLa cells on top of gold nanorods.
The left image shows the Stokes emission, where a $633\nm$ notch and $633\nm$
long pass filter were employed. The right image corresponds to the anti-Stokes
emission, where the same notch and a $633\nm$ short pass filter were employed.
In both cases the irradiation intensity was kept at $120\uW$ at the back
aperture of the objective. Most particles are observed with both sets of
filters but with different intensities. The main difference between the two images is the background count rate.
The Stokes image has an average count rate around $40\textrm{k}\CPS$, while the
anti-Stokes is below $100\CPS$, close to the dark counts of the detector.
Moreover in the Stokes image a structured background can be observed; we
attribute this emission to self-fluorescence of the cells. On the other hand, the
anti-Stokes image shows a much flatter background and highly
distinguishable single particles. Both images display the absolute count rate
obtained without any further dark count subtraction.

To prove the usefulness of the method in situations with higher
background, we incubated the cells with a solution of \atto.
The staining of the cell, even if not specific, results in a similar situation
to what would be obtained in the case of labeling of organelles or
the entire cell membrane. This dye was chosen because its absorption maximum is
close to $633\nm$, the excitation wavelength we employed in these
experiments, but also because of its photo stability and high quantum yield.

The scale bar in both figures is $5\um$ in length.}
	\label{fig:Stokes_AS_with_dye}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Stokes_AS_with_dye} shows two raster scans of the samples
described above. The right panel shows the anti-Stokes image, in which single
particles are clearly distinguishable. The left panel shows the Stokes
emission, in which no particles can be distinguished from the background. The
average emission in the anti-Stokes image is close to $500\CPS$, higher than the
dark counts of the detector. The Stokes emission, on the other hand shows an
average intensity around $200\textrm{kCPS}$, one order of magnitude
higher than that observed without the dye.

These results indicate that the Stokes image deteriorates much faster than the
anti-Stokes in the presence of emitting molecules both from the cell itself or
from added dyes. The images show regions with higher
emission intensities in both configurations, most probably due to a higher concentration
of dye in specific regions of the cell. At much higher concentrations than
the ones employed in this work, the dye has also shown anti-Stokes emission at
rates even higher than the particles, indicating that anti-Stokes emission also occurs for dyes.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/06_Power_Intensity/power_intensity.png}
	\caption{Emission intensity and background as functions of excitation intensity for the
	Stokes (red) and the anti-Stokes (blue)
	emissions. These data were obtained on a particle with its plasmon close to the laser line, so as to
	avoid favouring one or the other emission. Arrows indicate the maximal signal-to-background ratio of each emission in the figure conditions. }
	\label{fig:power_intensity}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:power_intensity}a shows the dependence of the acquired
luminescence and the background as functions of excitation power for both the
Stokes and anti-Stokes emissions of a particle below a cell without dye. Care
was taken in choosing a particle with a resonance close to the excitation laser,
to compare Stokes and anti-Stokes luminescences with similar resonant enhancements. The Stokes
emission (red curves) shows a linear increase in signal together with a linear
increase in background. In this case the signal-to-background ratio reaches a
value of $5$. The anti-Stokes emission (blue curves) however shows a much
steeper increase of the signal than the background, reaching a
signal-to-background ratio of $10$. The signal-to-background ratio of the
anti-Stokes is twice higher than the Stokes one. Of course, particles with a plasmon
resonance to the blue of the laser wavelength show an even larger ratio of anti-Stokes to Stokes signal-to-background ratios.

Figure \ref{fig:power_intensity}b shows the same type of curves than
\ref{fig:power_intensity}a, but for a particle under cells that were stained
with \atto. It can readily be seen that in the Stokes case the particle's signal is hardly larger than the dye fluorescence background. On the other hand, the
anti-Stokes luminescence shows an enhanced contrast, reaching a
signal-to-background ratio of more than $20$. The background level observed in the Stokes image increases much faster with dye content than the
anti-Stokes background. 

When the cells were stained with \atto, we observed an increase in the
background levels for both Stokes and anti-Stokes emission and these levels also
depend on excitation power. This means that the dye fluorescence shows both components, as is well known from fluorescence hot bands and anti-Stokes Raman scattering. The main difference between nanoparticles and dyes, however, is their quantum yield.
While the particles appear to be relatively bright anti-Stokes emitters, in part
due to their large absorption cross section, in part due to their plasmon resonance, dyes such as the one
employed in this work, are much better Stokes emitters than anti-Stokes. This is
the main reason why rods are drowned by the fluorescence background in the Stokes image.

The signal-to-background ratio of the anti-Stokes emission increases with
increasing laser excitation powers, going from values close to $2$ for $10\uW$
excitation up to values of $20$ for $150\uW$ as shown in fig
\ref{fig:power_intensity}b. However this can't be extrapolated further than the
results here presented. It is known that gold nanorods reshape under high
irradiation intensities. For high-NA objectives like the one employed in this
work, a rule of thumb to prevent reshaping in scanning confocal images is to keep the excitation intensity lower than $150\uW$ at the back aperture of the objective lens.

\section{Conclusions}
In this work we have demonstrated that anti-Sokes photoluminescence arising from the
excitation in (or close to) the plasmon resonance of a gold nanorod can be
exploited to image\cite{Jiang2013} them in biologically relevant conditions. The
comparison between the Stokes and anti-Stokes emissions was possible by using particles
immobilized on the substrate, but this work shows that the technique can be
easily extended to imaging in fixed cells, in vivo or even for tracking
particles in real time\cite{VandenBroek2013}.

Extending this technique to wide-field should be possible considering the laser
powers employed in this work. EMCCDs provide enough gain\cite{Dussault2004} to
easily detect single nanoparticles, while at the same time the background is
sufficiently low to give a high contrast. This extension of the technique would
provide a way of doing tracking at higher frame rates than achievable by
confocal imaging.

The lower count rate of the anti-Stokes compared to the Stokes emission can be a
drawback in such applications as localization\cite{Sahl2013}. This technique's
accuracy depends on the number of photons detected, and is given by $\approx
1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of photons collected. The count rates
obtained in this work are close to $1.5\,\textrm{kCPS}$, and should be enough
for many applications. 

We have shown that the signal-to-background ratio of the anti-Stokes emission is
higher than for the Stokes emission. In the case of non stained HeLa cells,
typical values can be around $10$ and $5$ respectively for a particle with a
resonance at the laser wavelength. For stained cells the difference is
much more pronounced, since most of the particles will have a Stokes emission
comparable to the background, while in the anti-Stokes the signal-to-background
ratio can still be higher than $10$.

The main advantage of the technique presented in this work is that it can be
easily implemented in any commercial or home-built microscope. It does not
require a high investment in equipment or time, since filters are
normally available for common laser wavelengths and there is no further need of
modifying any experimental configuration already existent. Moreover all the data
analysis techniques employed in confocal or wide-field images for localization,
tracking, etc. do not have to be modified.
