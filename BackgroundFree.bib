abstract = {Gold nanorods (AuNRs) are among the promising emerging fluorescent labels for cellular imaging. However, it is unclear whether AuNRs can specifically label molecular target and fluorescent imaging at a subcellular level. Here we have used AuNRs linked to cystine and folic acid (FA) to label live cancer cells, and to detect the distributions of FA receptors on cell membrane. The labeling signals are specific for intended targets and more photostable than comparable organic dyes, rhodamine B. Using AuNRs with different excitation wavelength, we simultaneously detect one cellular target with different labeling colors. Furthermore, AuNRs-labeled red and AuNRs-labeled green came from the same cellular targets are observed with different filter sets. This result indicates that AuNRs-based fluorescent nanoprobes can be very effective in cellular imaging and offer substantial advantage over organic dyes in multicolor target detection. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We used a confocal laser microscope to investigate the one-photon photoluminescence (PL) of gold antennas. The PL spectra can be precisely fitted to a plasmon-enhanced PL model. For increasing the antenna length, the energy peak position decreases continuously until it reaches a value of 1.7–1.8 eV. For longer antennas and smaller plasmon energies, we observe an additional, persistent shoulder in the PL spectra, which we explain by a Gaussian-shaped peak at $\Delta$?≈1.78–1.79 eV. We attribute this behavior to the opening of an additional decay path for electrons at the gold interband transition edge, which we observe only for long antennas.},

AuNRs corresponding to three different length-to-diameter aspect ratios (AR)?1.86, 2.91, and 3.90?were examined using single-nanorod spectroscopy and imaging; the nanorod volume was approximately constant over the three sample types. For each AuNR, an aspect ratio-independent transverse plasmon resonance (TSPR) was detected at 2.41 eV. Aspect-ratio-dependent longitudinal surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) were observed at 2.08 ± 0.19 eV, 1.76 ± 0.12 eV, and 1.53 ± 0.15 eV for the 1.86-AR, 2.91-AR, and 3.90-AR samples, respectively. On the basis of both excitation and emission polarization-resolved two-photon photoluminescence (TPPL) measurements, AuNR PL emission proceeded by plasmon-mediated radiative electron?hole recombination. The resonant LSPR mode frequencies of the nanorods were determined from interferometrically detected TPPL signals. For these measurements, the interpulse time delays of a spectrally broad laser pulse (1.48?1.65 eV) were changed systematically with attosecond time resolution, and the TPPL signal amplitude was recorded.

The LSPR frequencies were obtained by Fourier transformation of the time-domain TPPL data and compared to dark-field scattering spectra. The accuracy of the interferometric TPPL measurement for recovering plasmon resonance frequencies was confirmed by polarization-dependent measurements; alignment of the laser electric field parallel to the nanorod major axis was LSPR resonant, whereas projection of the laser pulse into an orthogonal plane was not. Finally, dephasing times (T2) for resonant plasmon modes were extracted from analysis of interferometric TPPL and second harmonic generation data. These results showed that the dephasing time increased from 22 ± 4 to 31 ± 9 fs as the LSPR resonance energy decreased from 1.76 to 1.53 eV, as a result of less efficient plasmon dephasing due to interband scattering for lower energy resonances. These results demonstrate the capability of interferometric nonlinear optical imaging with single-nanostructure sensitivity for determining structure-specific dephasing times, which influence the efficiency of metal nanoparticle light-harvesting applications.

New optical methods provide access to the absorption, emission, or excitation spectra of single nano-objects and can determine either the positions of these objects with subwavelength accuracy or the full three-dimensional orientation of their transition dipole moments. Recent work aims at using single molecules as nanoparts or nanoelements in a variety of molecular-scale devices, from triggered sources of single photons to single-molecular switches. A prominent new direction explores the various interactions between molecules within individual multichromophoric systems obtained by chemical synthesis. These systems are the models for natural self-assembled systems such as the light-harvesting proteins of bacteria and green plants, which are currently studied on a single-molecule basis. Another important class of multichromophoric systems are conjugated polymers. The combination of microscopy with time- and frequency-resolved spectroscopy is opening a wide field of new and exciting applications to individual nano-objects.},

Briefly covering the basic principles, this short review then summarizes key recent developments and application examples of two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) multi-color techniques and faster time-lapse schemes.

abstract = {This article provides an overview of current research into the synthesis and properties of gold nanorods. Interest in rod-shaped nanoparticles stems from their unique optical properties, which can be approximated by Mie–Gans theory. We begin by outlining briefly the origin of the shape-dependent optical properties of rods. The different synthetic strategies that have been developed to achieve decent yields and sample monodispersity are then described, and the methods used for physical characterization as well as results of inorganic structure studies follow. Some of the most innovative research dealing with surface modification and chemical reactivity of gold nanorods is highlighted, together with new directions such as the synthesis of core-shell particles and the interactions of gold nanorods with biomolecules. Gold nanorods can be excited by ultrafast laser-induced heating; the resulting relaxation processes are important in determining the material properties of the metal particles. In addition, vibrational modes and shape changes are elucidated, and a theoretical analysis of the expected behavior is also presented. The incorporation of the gold nanorods into thin films and gels provides a new avenue for designing and growing materials with anisotropic optical properties. Initial results on the optical properties of such nanocomposites are reviewed. This review is concluded with a section devoted to the future perspectives for gold rods as novel materials.},

For rods of the same width, the yield is found to increase quadratically while the wavelength maximum increases linearly with the length. We assign this emission to the electron and hole interband recombination. The increase in the emission yield results from the enhancement effect of the incoming and outgoing electric fields via coupling to the surface plasmon resonance in the rods.

abstract = {Human exposure to nanoparticles is inevitable as nanoparticles become more widely used and, as a result, nanotoxicology research is now gaining attention. However, while the number of nanoparticle types and applications continues to increase, studies to characterize their effects after exposure and to address their potential toxicity are few in comparison. In the medical field in particular, nanoparticles are being utilized in diagnostic and therapeutic tools to better understand, detect, and treat human diseases. Exposure to nanoparticles for medical purposes involves intentional contact or administration; therefore, understanding the properties of nanoparticles and their effect on the body is crucial before clinical use can occur. This Review presents a summary of the in vitro cytotoxicity data currently available on three classes of nanoparticles. With each of these nanoparticles, different data has been published about their cytotoxicity due to varying experimental conditions as well as differing nanoparticle physiochemical properties. For nanoparticles to move into the clinical arena, it is important that nanotoxicology research uncovers and understands how these multiple factors influence the toxicity of nanoparticles so that their undesirable properties can be avoided. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH a Co.

Gold nanorods feature a strong plasmon-enhanced two-photon luminescence, can be easily functionalized, and have been shown to be nontoxic. These properties make gold nanorods very suitable for in vivo two-photon luminescence microscopy. By rapid multifocal scanning, we combine the advantages of 3D molecular tracking methods using wide-field imaging with the advantages of two-photon microscopy. Isolated gold nanorods can be localized with a resolution of 4 nm in the xy-plane and 8 nm in the z-direction. The polarization-dependence of the two-photon luminescence signal can be used to resolve the angular orientation, even when two gold nanorods are separated by less than the diffraction limit. Individual nanorods in live U2OS cells could be followed in 3 dimensions for over 30 min, with a photon noise limited accuracy, and a time resolution of 50 ms in 2D and 500 ms in 3D.},

Using the information obtained from the single particle studies, we were able to successfully employ one-photon luminescence for correlation spectroscopy measurements and to correctly interpret auto- and cross-correlation functions, which were used to determine the hydrodynamic sizes of several gold nanoparticle samples and to extract rotational dynamics of nanorods. Because of the difference in size dependence for one-photon luminescence compared to scattering, luminescence correlation spectroscopy of metal nanoparticles is advantageous as it is not as strongly affected by the presence of larger nanoparticles or aggregates.

@article{Hu2008,
abstract = {This article provides a review of our recent Rayleigh scattering measurements on single metal nanoparticles. Two different systems will be discussed in detail: gold nanorods with lengths between 30 and 80 nm, and widths between 8 and 30 nm; and hollow gold-silver nanocubes (termed nanoboxes or nanocages depending on their exact morphology) with edge lengths between 100 and 160 nm, and wall thicknesses of the order of 10 nm. The goal of this work is to understand how the linewidth of the localized surface plasmon resonance depends on the size, shape, and environment of the nanoparticles. Specifically, the relative contributions from bulk dephasing, electron-surface scattering, and radiation damping (energy loss via coupling to the radiation field) have been determined by examining particles with different dimensions. This separation is possible because the magnitude of the radiation damping effect is proportional to the particle volume, whereas, the electron-surface scattering contribution is inversely proportional to the dimensions. For the nanorods, radiation damping is the dominant effect for thick rods (widths greater than 20 nm), while electron-surface scattering is dominant for thin rods (widths less than 10 nm). Rods with widths in between these limits have narrow resonances-approaching the value determined by the bulk contribution. For nanoboxes and nanocages, both radiation damping and electron-surface scattering are significant at all sizes. This is because these materials have thin walls, but large edge lengths and, therefore, relatively large volumes. The effect of the environment on the localized surface plasmon resonance has also been studied for nanoboxes. Increasing the dielectric constant of the surroundings causes a red-shift and an increase in the linewidth of the plasmon band. The increase in linewidth is attributed to enhanced radiation damping.},

abstract = {Tailoring the longitudinal surface plasmon wavelengths (LSPWs), scattering, and absorption cross sections of gold nanorods has been demonstrated by combining anisotropic shortening and transverse overgrowth and judiciously choosing starting Au nanorods. Shortening yields Au nanorods with decreasing lengths but a fixed diameter, while overgrowth produces nanorods with increasing diameters but a nearly unchanged length. Two series of Au nanorods with LSPWs varying in the same spectral range but distinct extinction coefficients are thus obtained. The systematic changes in the LSPW and extinction for the two series of Au nanorods are found to be in good agreement with those obtained from Gans theory. Dark-field imaging performed on two representative nanorod samples with similar LSPWs shows that the scattering intensities of the overgrown nanorods are much larger than those of the shortened nanorods. The experimental results are found to be in very good agreement with those obtained from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. FDTD calculations further reveal that the scattering-to-extinction ratio increases linearly as a function of the diameter for Au nanorods with a fixed aspect ratio.},

abstract = {The dependence of the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and the electron heat capacity on the electron temperature is investigated for eight representative metals, Al, Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, W, and Ti, for the conditions of strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium. These conditions are characteristic of metal targets subjected to energetic ion bombardment or short-pulse laser irradiation. Computational analysis based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of the electron density of states predicts large deviations (up to an order of magnitude) from the commonly used approximations of linear temperature dependence of the electron heat capacity and a constant electron-phonon coupling. These thermophysical properties are found to be very sensitive to details of the electronic structure of the material. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling can either increase (Al, Au, Ag, Cu, and W), decrease (Ni and Pt), or exhibit nonmonotonic changes (Ti) with increasing electron temperature. The electron heat capacity can exhibit either positive (Au, Ag, Cu, and W) or negative (Ni and Pt) deviations from the linear temperature dependence. The large variations of the thermophysical properties, revealed in this work for the range of electron temperatures typically realized in femtosecond laser material processing applications, have important implications for quantitative computational analysis of ultrafast processes associated with laser interaction with metals.},

We find a drastic reduction of the plasmon dephasing rate in nanorods as compared to small nanospheres due to a suppression of interband damping. The rods studied here also show very little radiation damping, due to their small volumes. These findings imply large local-field enhancement factors and relatively high light-scattering efficiencies, making metal nanorods extremely interesting for optical applications. Comparison with theory shows that pure dephasing and interface damping give negligible contributions to the total plasmon dephasing rate.},

abstract = {Femtosecond electron thermalization in metals was investigated using transient thermomodulation transmissivity and reflectivity. Studies were performed using a tunable multiple-wavelength femtosecond pump-probe technique in optically thin gold films in the low perturbation limit. An IR pump beam is used to heat the electron distribution and changes in electron temperature are measured with a visible probe beam at the d band to Fermi-surface transition. We show that the subpicosecond optical response of gold is dominated by delayed thermalization of the electron gas. This effect is particularly important far off the spectral peak of the reflectivity or transmissivity changes, permitting a direct and sensitive access to the internal thermalization of the electron gas. Using a simple rate-equation model, line-shape analysis of the transient reflectivity and transmissivity indicates a thermalization time of the order of 500 fs. At energies close to the Fermi surface, longer thermalization times ∼1–2 ps are observed. These results are in agreement with a more sophisticated model based on calculations of the electron-thermalization dynamics by numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation. This model quantitatively describes the measured transient optical response during the full thermalization time of electron gas, of the order of 1.5 ps, and gives new insight into electron thermalization in metals.},

The observed trend in QY is further confirmed by controlled reshaping of a single gold nanorod to a spherelike shape. Moreover, we identify two spectral components, one around 500 nm originating from a combination of interband transitions and the transverse plasmon and one coinciding with the longitudinal plasmon band. These components are analyzed by correlating scattering and luminescence spectra of single nanorods and performing polarization sensitive measurements. Our study contributes to the understanding of luminescence from gold nanorods. The enhanced QY we report can benefit applications in biological and soft matter studies.},

Development of a high-throughput nanopore-based biosensor requires multiplexing of nanopore measurements. Electrical detection, however, poses a challenge, as each nanopore circuit must be electrically independent, which requires complex nanofluidics and embedded electrodes. Here, we present an optical method for simultaneous measurements of the ionic current across an array of solid-state nanopores, requiring no additional fabrication steps. Proof-of-principle experiments are conducted that show simultaneous optical detection and characterization of ssDNA and dsDNA using an array of pores.

abstract = {The biological functions of the cell membrane are influenced by the mobility of its constituents, which are thought to be strongly affected by nanoscale structure and organization. Interactions with the actin cytoskeleton have been proposed as a potential mechanism with the control of mobility imparted through transmembrane "pickets" or GPI-anchored lipid nanodomains. This hypothesis is based on observations of molecular mobility using various methods, although many of these lack the spatiotemporal resolution required to fully capture all the details of the interaction dynamics. In addition, the validity of certain experimental approaches, particularly single-particle tracking, has been questioned due to a number of potential experimental artifacts. Here, we use interferometric scattering microscopy to track molecules labeled with 20-40 nm scattering gold beads with simultaneous {\textless}2 nm spatial and 20 $\mu$s temporal precision to investigate the existence and mechanistic origin of anomalous diffusion in bilayer membranes. We use supported lipid bilayers as a model system and demonstrate that the label does not influence time-dependent diffusion in the small particle limit (≤40 nm). By tracking the motion of the ganglioside lipid GM1 bound to the cholera toxin B subunit for different substrates and lipid tail properties, we show that molecular pinning and interleaflet coupling between lipid tail domains on a nanoscopic scale suffice to induce transient immobilization and thereby anomalous subdiffusion on the millisecond time scale.},

We study continuous-wave (cw) and pulsed-laser excitation of aqueous suspensions of Au nanorods as a model system for secondary light emission from plasmonic nanostructures. Resonant secondary emission contributes significantly to the background commonly observed in surface-enhanced Raman scattering and to the light emission generated by pulsed-laser excitation of metallic nanostructures that is often attributed to two-photon luminescence. Spectra collected using cw laser excitation at 488 nm show an enhancement of the broad spectrum of emission at the electromagnetic plasmon resonance of the nanorods. The intensity of anti-Stokes emission collected using cw laser excitation at 785 nm is described by a 300 K thermal distribution of excitations. Excitation by subpicosecond laser pulses at 785 nm broadens and increases the intensity of the anti-Stokes emission in a manner that is consistent with electronic Raman scattering by a high-temperature distribution of electronic excitations predicted by a two-temperature model. Broadening of the pulse duration using an etalon reduces the intensity of anti-Stokes emission in quantitative agreement with the model. Experiments using a pair of subpicosecond optical pulses separated by a variable delay show that the timescale of resonant secondary emission is comparable to the timescale for equilibration of electrons and phonons.},

abstract = {We used coherent anti-Stokes scattering (CAS) to characterize individual gold nanorods (GNRs) and GNR aggregates. By creating samples with different densities of GNRs on silicon wafer substrates, we were able to determine surface coverage by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and then correlate the coverage to the CAS intensities of the samples. The observed CAS signal intensity was quadratically dependent on the number of particles. We also examined the CAS signal as a function of the excitation polarization and found that the strongest signals in regularly oriented GNRs were observed when the beam polarization was aligned with the longitudinal axis of the GNRs. Irregularly oriented GNRs exhibited a different scattering pattern to that observed for regularly oriented GNRs. The polarization-dependent scattering from oriented GNRs showed cos(6)($\theta$) behavior. By imaging nanoscale-sized GNR patterns using CAS and evaluating the results with SEM, we show that CAS can be used for efficient, label-free imaging of nanoscale metallic particles.},

We have successfully extracted only a vibrationally resonant CARS image from a characteristic spectral profile in the C-H stretching vibrational region. Using our simple but sensitive analysis, the vibrational contrast is significantly improved in comparison with a CARS imaging at a fixed Raman shift. The CARS image of a living yeast cell indicates several areas at which the signal is remarkably strong. They are considered to arise from mitochondria.},

The disadvantages and limitations of the earlier method (i.e., formation of noncylindrical NRs, $\phi$-shaped particles, and formation of a large fraction of spherical particles) have been overcome by use of a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-capped seed instead of a citrate-capped one. In a single-component surfactant system, the silver content of the growth solution was used to grow NRs to a desired length. This results in reproducible formation of NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 1.5 to 4.5. To grow longer NRs with aspect ratios ranging from 4.6 to 10, a binary surfactant mixture composed of benzyldimethylhexadecylammoniumchloride (BDAC) and CTAB was used. NRs are grown in this mixture either by aging or by addition of a growth solution suitable to shorter NRs.

abstract = {We propose and demonstrate a new method of an all-optical, contactless, one-step injection of single gold nanoparticles through phospholipid membranes. The method is based on the combination of strong optical forces acting on and simultaneous optical heating of a gold nanoparticle exposed to laser light tuned to the plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle. A focused laser beam captures single nanoparticles from the colloidal suspension, guides them toward a phospholipid vesicle and propels them through the gel-phase membrane, resulting in the nanoparticle internalization into the vesicle. Efficient resonant optical heating of the gold nanoparticle causes a pore to form in the gel-phase membrane, a few-hundred nanometers in size, which remains open for several minutes.},

abstract = {We show that, when gold nanospheres are excited at the red side of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) wavelength at 592 nm by a continuous wave (CW) laser, they give substantial up-converted luminescence in the SPR wavelength range. The luminescence intensity scales as a second-order function of the excitation power, with a quantum yield ∼1/50 of down-conversion luminescence when illuminated at a power of 30 MW/cm(2). The luminescence spectrum is completely different than the SPR profile, indicating a new emission mechanism possibly involving interband transitions coupled with phonons or localized vibration of neighboring gold atoms. Such luminescence is also observed to be substantial for short gold nanorods with an aspect ratio of ∼2 but weak for bulk gold. This study provides new insight to the understanding of gold nanoparticle luminescence and opens a new detection scheme for gold nanoparticle-based biological imaging.},
